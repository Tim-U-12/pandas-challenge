Summary Analysis <br>
From analysis we can infer that independent schools perform better generally by a small margin. The small difference is probably not enough to conclude indefinitely that independent schools do better.

Scores by School Spending <br>
Our "spending_summary" dataframe indicates that the more money spent per student does not result in better marks. The spending range "$585-630" yielded the best averages and also had the highest passing percentage. This was the 2nd lowest spending range. As the spending range increased, the results yieled seemeingly dropped. 
<br>

Scores by School Type <br>
From our "type_summary" dataframe, we can see that the average math and reading scores differ by no more than 2% between government and independent schools. This indicates that on average, children from independent schools tend to score higher on average. That being said, the difference is quite low which may mean the difference between the types could be reversed if not for potential sampling error. Alongside the averages, we can use the passing percentages of both math and reading to infer that the government school may have larger spread in marks in comparison to independent schools. This is because the passing percentage difference between government and independent schools is a lot larger than the difference in their averages.
